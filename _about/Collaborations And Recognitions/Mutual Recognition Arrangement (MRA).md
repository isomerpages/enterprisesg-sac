<p>The objective of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) is to develop
a global network of conformity assessment bodies. This includes certification
bodies, testing and calibration laboratories, and inspection bodies, which
can be relied on to provide competent services, such as certification activities,
testing, calibration and inspection. Key to international trade, the MRAs
promote cross border stakeholder confidence and the acceptance of accredited
conformity assessment bodies.</p>
<h3>Benefit from MRAs?</h3>
<p>SAC's signatory status in the MRAs is a global passport for enterprises
in Singapore. There is no need for duplicative re-testing, re-inspection
or re-calibration of goods upon entry to importing countries. Moreover,
government agencies these days rely more on results from accredited facilities
as well as those of the MRA partners, as they begin to realise the credibility
of accreditation programmes that are based on internationally recognised
standards.</p>
<h3>How do MRAs work?</h3>
<p>An MRA is based on the results of intensive peer evaluation of its signatories.
The accreditation body to the MRA must agree to abide by the requirements
in ISO/IEC 17011: Conformity assessment - General Requirements for accreditation
bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies. They must ensure that
the conformity assessment bodies that they accredit conform to standards,
such as ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 15189 for laboratories, ISO/IEC 17020 for
inspection bodies, and ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17021 for accreditation
of certification bodies.</p>
<h3>How to Recognise Accredited Reports &amp; Certificates?</h3>
<p>Once a laboratory or inspection body becomes accredited, it is granted
exclusive use of the logo belonging to the particular accreditation body
that issued its accreditation. The accredited body can only refer to its
accreditation according to the respective tests, calibration or inspection.
For easier recognition across borders, the International Laboratory Accreditation
Cooperation (ILAC) has come up with an internationally recognised mark
called the ILAC mark. This is to be used alongside the logo of the accreditation
body. An example of how the ILAC mark is used by accredited laboratories
in Singapore is demonstrated below:

<h3>OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD)</h3>
<p>Since January 2010, Singapore became an adherent member of the OECD Mutual
Acceptance of Data (MAD) framework. GLP studies conducted in Singapore
will now be recognised in more than 30 OECD member and non-member countries.</p>
<p>The video below shows the Key elements of the OECD Framework for Mutual
Acceptance of Data and Good Laboratory Practices.</p>

<h3>Energy Star Programme</h3>
<p>On 6 October 2010, SAC was formally recognised by the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) for the ENERGY STAR Programme. From December 30
2010, all ENERGY STAR product partners are required to have their products
certified by an EPA-recognised Certification Body (CB) prior to qualification.
Before applying for EPA recognition, the CB will need to gain accreditation
to ISO/IEC 17065. Similarly, the testing laboratory must first be accredited
to ISO/IEC 17025 for test methods required by the relevant ENERGY STAR
product specifications, before applying for recognition by EPA.</p>
<h3>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Telecommunications MRA</h3>
<p>Singapore has signed an MRA on telecom equipment certification with the
United States. The MRA provides for direct entry of telecommunications
into either market without the need for additional testing and certification.
Under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Telecommunications MRA
implemented between the United States and Singapore, products can be tested
and certified in the United States for conformance with Singapore's technical
requirements. A list of the recognized U.S. testing and certification agencies
can be found <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/Who-We-Are/international-relations/mutual-recognition-arrangements" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
