<p>Formed in 1996, the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is the national
authority for the independent accreditation of conformity assessment bodies
in Singapore. Operating under Enterprise Singapore, a statutory board of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry, SAC also builds trust in Singapore
products and services by strengthening Singapore's technical infrastructure
for conformity assessments and forging mutual recognition agreements (MRAs)
with our economic partners. SAC's primary function is to accredit conformity
assessment services, such as testing, calibration, inspection and certification.</p>
