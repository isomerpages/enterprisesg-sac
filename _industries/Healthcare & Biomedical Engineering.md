<p>The healthcare and biomedical industry includes pharmaceuticals, medical
equipment, complementary health products, and more. Its related services
sector is centered on the provision of healthcare in various forms, ranging
from hospital stays to home nurses. Given the wide scope of the industry,
the healthcare value chain consists of several stakeholders, each involved
in various activities that may be product or service-oriented.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the healthcare and biomedical industry is rapidly growing.
There is significant public investment in research aimed at driving productivity
and innovation. Along with Industry 4.0, this presents several new possibilities
in the advancement of healthcare products and services. The pace of innovations,
however, creates a greater need for conformity assessment.</p>
<p>Conformity assessment safeguards public health and safety considerations
in the industry. Testing laboratories, as well as inspection and certification
bodies, offer a wide spectrum of services that cover all segments of the
industry, from pharmaceuticals and equipment to healthcare facilities.
Specific assessments are available at each step of the value chain. An
example is the use of relevant safety tests and product validation to ensure
the safety of medical technology and complementary health products.</p>
<p>Good Laboratory Practice programmes and Quality Management Systems certification
(e.g. ISO 13485) are additional options for supporting the validation of
medical devices. These require particularly robust quality management and
assurance to ensure consistency across different markets.</p>
<p>Quality Management Systems apply to healthcare services and medical testing
as well. Standards such as ISO 15189 are used to assess compliance of medical
laboratories to international requirements.</p>
<p>ISO 9001 is also commonly used by healthcare providers, though standards
specific to the sector such as DIN EN 15224 (a European standard) are also
available for businesses who seek differentiation through a higher level
of quality healthcare.</p>
<p>SAC has accreditation schemes for laboratories as well as inspection and
certification bodies who offer conformity assessment services. These support
businesses in the healthcare and biomedical industry by providing added
credibility and assurance.</p>
<p>The following SAC Accreditation Programmes are applicable to the healthcare
and biomedical industry:</p>
