## Who can Apply?
The SAC accreditation schemes are open to all conformity assessment bodies (CABs) such as laboratories, inspection and certification bodies.

We also administer the Singapore Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Compliance Programme. The SAC GLP Compliance Programme is open to all Test Facilities.

## How to Get Accredited?

It can take between three to six months for organisations to obtain their SAC accreditation or SAC GLP registration.  This is dependent on a number of factors, such as the degree of the organisation's compliance with requirements, the complexity of scope of accreditation and the availability of witnessing and clearance of incidences of non-conformance highlighted during the assessment. The SAC application process covers:

#### 1. Basic Requirements

To apply for SAC accreditation, a CAB must first provide evidence of fulfilling the base requirements outlined in the relevant standards. ISO/IEC 17020, 17021-1, 17024, 17025, 17043, 17065 and ISO 15189. To apply for SAC GLP registration programme, a facility must first provide evidence of fulfilling the base requirements of OECD principles of Good Laboratory Practices (1997).  It must also be a registered legal entity. SAC documents pertaining to the different schemes can be accessed [here](/resources/sac-documents).
