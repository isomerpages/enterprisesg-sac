## About
![Accreditation of Proficiency Testing Providers](/images/services/proficiency-testing-accreditation-services.jpg)

Proficiency testing involves the use of inter-laboratory comparisons for the determination of laboratory performance. The need for ongoing confidence in laboratory performance is not only essential for laboratories and their customers, but also for other interested parties such as regulators and accreditation bodies.

Proficiency testing (PT) providers play an important role in the value chain for assurance of products and services. Their proficiency testing schemes should be properly designed and statistically robust, so that the benchmarking of participants’ performance is properly conducted, and the participants can monitor trends and identify gaps in their own performances for corrective actions and improvements.

Third-party endorsements of proficiency testing providers’ capabilities are needed to demonstrate they have met international standards. SAC can provide that recognition so as to give credibility to their programmes and boost confidence in customers. With accreditation, the local PT providers will be able to market their services confidently within Singapore and also in the ASEAN and international arena.

SAC officially launched the Accreditation Scheme for Proficiency Testing Providers (PTP) on 14 August 2013.

### Accreditation Criteria   

The primary standard used for accreditation of proficiency testing providers is ISO/IEC 17043 (Conformity Assessment – General Requirements for the competence of proficiency testing providers). The requirements in this standard apply to areas such as management, planning and design, personnel, assuring quality and confidentiality for organising PT schemes.

This is a voluntary scheme that is open to all facilities. SAC accreditation is only granted for the specific scope(s) put up for accreditation.

### Benefits

Being an accredited PTP gives the organisation credibility for their PT services. Aside from attaining a systematic and well-designed quality system, accredited organisations also stand to gain from the Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) that SAC has signed. This allows them access to international markets.

In addition, with the pool of accredited local PTPs available, customers such as laboratories will have access to more affordable and reliable sources of PT programmes.

### Process

A facility seeking recognition for compliance with ISO/IEC 17043 should apply to SAC, stating its proposed scope and type of PT scheme for recognition. It has to provide key information on:

a) Management structure

b) Key responsibilities of the personnel and units

c) Persons in charge of PT programme(s)

d) Quality manual and standard operating procedures, among other documents

SAC will do a documentation review before the on-site assessment, which is done to determine compliance with ISO/IEC 17043. The facility must complete at least one PT scheme for the applied scope before the assessment. The on-site assessment will be conducted by a Team Leader accompanied by relevant technical assessors as determined by SAC. Assessment may take more than one day, depending on the scope and size of the PT provider.

Once a PT Provider has demonstrated compliance with our requirements, it will be recommended for accreditation. Once approved, SAC will grant a certificate of accreditation. The detailed description of the type of assessment is stipulated in PTP-003, Accreditation Process.
