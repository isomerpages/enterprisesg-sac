## About

Accreditation is an endorsement of a validation/verification body's independence, integrity and technical competence. Most importantly, accreditation provides a validation/verification body (V/VB) with a trust mark and confidence to offer its services nationally and globally.

### About the Schemes

*Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation*

The Accreditation Scheme for Greenhouse Gas Validation &amp; Verification Body was launched on 24 August 2018 for organisations providing third-party validation/verification services for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gases (GHG). This new accreditation scheme was developed in response to the increasing demand for sustainability and to support the aviation industry for the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) initiated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). CORSIA is a global voluntary market-based measure scheme to address any annual increase in total CO2 emissions from international civil aviation.  SAC also offers accreditation for verification at organisation level based on ISO 14064-1 and verification of carbon footprint of product based on ISO 14067.



### Accreditation Criteria

SAC accredits validation and verification bodies that can demonstrate compliance with the following requirements stated in SAC CT 01, which includes the following requirements:: 

* ISO/IEC 17029 Conformity assessment – General principles and requirements for  verification and validation bodies
* ISO 14065 General principles and requirements for bodies validating and verifying environmental information
* ISO 14066 Greenhouse gases Environmental information – Competence requirements for teams validating and verifying environmental information
* ISO 14064-3 Greenhouse Gases - Part 3: Specification with Guidance for the verification and validation of Greenhouse gas assertions  
* IAF MD 6 IAF Mandatory Document for the application of ISO 14065:2020 



### Benefits

Accreditation will:

* <b>Increase confidence</b>: Widely recognised by regulators and the industry, SAC accredited certificates instil greater confidence in those who choose to engage the services of SAC accredited V/VBs.
 
### Process
Upon receiving the application for accreditation, qualified assessors are assigned to assess the system of operations of the V/VBs and the competence of the validators/verifiers. This will be carried out through a document review, assessments at the V/VB's office as well as on-site witnessed assessments of validation/ verification - all conducted by the V/VB. When the V/VB has demonstrated compliance with our requirements, it will be recommended for accreditation. One approved, SAC will grant a certificate of accreditation. The detailed description of the type of assessments is stipulated in CT 01, Accreditation Process.
