 # Updates to CABs on changes to SAC Certificates with effect from 01 July 2023

**Discontinuation of the issuance of physical SAC Certificates and transition to electronic versions**

SAC has previously issued physical SAC accreditation certificates to the SAC accredited CABs. In alignment with the overall government efforts on digitisation to improve efficiency and to better manage data and processes, SAC has transited with effect from 01 July 2023 to issue only electronic certificates to CABs. This change is also to align with the public service and Enterprise Singapore’s efforts to “go green” and reduce carbon footprint through reduction of paper usage. CABs will receive these certificates via SACiNet.

**Amendments to the SAC Certificate format**

To better safeguard the authenticity and improve the content security of SAC certificates, changes had been made to sign-off information with effect from 01 Jul 2023. In addition, SAC will also be including a unique QR Code on certificates that will link the CAB to specific SAC accreditation information in 2024.

If any SAC accredited CABs have clarifications on the above matters, please do contact your Account Manager.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
