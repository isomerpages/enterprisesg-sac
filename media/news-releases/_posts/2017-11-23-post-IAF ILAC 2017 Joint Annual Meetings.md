</p>
<p>The International Accreditation Forum (IAF) - International Laboratory
Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Joint Annual Meeting 2017 was held in
Vancouver, Canada from 21 to 30 October 2017. Singapore Accreditation Council
(SAC) participated as a full member of both ILAC and IAF with the aims
to achieve mutual acceptance of accreditation at the international level,
thus facilitating market access of Singapore goods and services to overseas
markets.</p>
<p>Some key developments and resolutions made at the meetings are:</p>
<p><strong>Expiry of ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 certificates:</strong>All
ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2014 shall expire or be withdrawn when the
three-year transition period ends on 15 September 2018. A resolution was
passed at IAF that as of 15 March 2018, certification bodies must conduct
all ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 initial, surveillance and recertification audits
to the new versions (i.e. ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015).</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Mandatory issuance of accredited personnel certifications:</strong>
<br>IAF accreditation body members shall have legally enforceable arrangements
with their accredited certification bodies for personnel certification
to ISO/IEC 17024 that prevents the certification bodies from issuing non-accredited
persons certificates in scopes for which they are accredited, and shall
require full implementation within 3 years from 30 October 2017.</p>
<p>SAC will keep accredited certification bodies informed on any IAF updates
regularly. More information on the IAF resolutions can be found <a href="https://iaf.nu/en/iaf-documents/resolutions/page/5/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>

<p><strong>IAF database of accredited management systems certificates:</strong>A
database of management system certificates provided by accredited certification
bodies will be established. The database presents a unique opportunity
for organisations with accredited certificates to be able to reach out
to potential buyers looking for suppliers that hold authentic certificates.
Accredited certification bodies and their certified clients are strongly
encouraged to participate in the database once the database project is
launched.</p>
<p>The next mid-year IAF/ILAC meeting will be held in Frankfurt, Germany
