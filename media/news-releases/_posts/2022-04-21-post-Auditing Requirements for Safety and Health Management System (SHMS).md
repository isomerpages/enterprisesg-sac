**Auditing Requirements for Safety and Health Management System (SHMS)**

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has issued a circular (MOM / OSHD / 2022-01) on 01 April 2022 to remind the SAC accredited Auditing Organisations (AOs) and their auditors, as well as occupiers of workplaces, on the audit requirements for mandatory SHMS audits, and to conduct the audits professionally and objectively.

SAC will take stern actions against AOs who do not maintain a standard of practice that complied with our accreditation requirements.
