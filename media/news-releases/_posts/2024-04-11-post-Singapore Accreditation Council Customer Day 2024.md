<p><strong>Singapore Accreditation Council Customer Day 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) Customer Day 2024, which took
place on 19 March at Orchard hotel Singapore, brought together 200 conformity
assessment bodies (CABs) and partners. &nbsp;The event, themed "Accreditation:
Empowering a Smart and Sustainable Future," served as a platform for companies
to exchange insights on key topics across digitalisation and sustainability
as well as share challenges and opportunities for the Testing, Inspection
and Certification (TIC) community in these areas. The event also celebrated
the recognition of 63 newly accredited CABs.</p>
<p>The SAC Chairman, Mr. Tan Kai Hoe, encouraged CABs to build new capabilities
and develop new processes and solutions to stay relevant and keep up with
the global evolution, especially across the two focus areas. The TIC sector,
as an enabler of quality and assurance, should also identify and capture
opportunities for growth across the two areas. He further add that to meet
the rising demand for new programmes and increased accreditation volume
while balancing resource and cost considerations, SAC has embarked on digitalisation
initiatives and initiated reviews to streamline and optimise our internal
processes to ensure operational sustainability.</p>
<p>The eventâ€™s keynote speaker, Associate Professor Edward Tay from the United
Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), encouraged CABs to
not take too long to plan and prepare and embark onto their journey of
sustainability and digitalisation immediately. In view of the evolving
trends globally, it is a more feasible approach to start small and progressively
refine and scale up over time than to plan for a perfect arrangement before
implementation. He added that many international organisations had already
been plugged into sustainability efforts and acknowledged the criticality
of roles which accreditation and the relevant international bodies play
to strengthen the quality and assurance infrastructure. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the SAC Customer Day 2024, a panel of distinguished industry speakers,
moderated by SAC Deputy Chairman Mr. Amos Leong discussed global sustainability
and digitisation trends, emphasising the ongoing importance of TIC services
in fostering trust and assurance in businesses and products. The panel
also highlighted the need for CABs to enhance productivity through digitalisation
and automation. Key takeaways from the panel discussions are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There is no perfect time to start sustainable and digitalisation journey.
It is crucial for companies to take the first step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation empowers employees to prioritise strategic tasks over routine
ones, enabling CABs to efficiently support their customers in bringing
products to market. This, in turn, enhances accuracy and traceability,
making CABs more attractive to larger companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organisations often encounter resistance to change during digital transformation.
Completing the project in phases can provide managers with an overview
of the results and benefits of the transformation efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the panel shared the following insights for sustainability:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Organisation can consider establishing sustainability committees to improve
processes for growth and operational efficiency. The committee can start
off with a minimum of 2 members to brainstorm and implement initiatives
on sustainability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Top-down leadership is important in driving sustainability and transformation.
They can facilitate learning by organising networking events or sustainability
classes for all company members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
