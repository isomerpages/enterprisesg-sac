<p><strong>Launch of Biorisk Management Audist Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is pleased to announce the expansion
of our Accreditation Scheme for Auditing Organisation (AO) to include the
scope of Bio-risk Management Audits with effect from 24 July 2024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>SAC’s Bio-risk Management Audits programme supports the industries and
the relevant regulatory authorities such as Ministry of Health (MOH) to
level up capabilities of bio-facilities in the management of biosafety
and biosecurity, and to ensure workplace health and safety. The programme
aims to build a network of recognised 3rd party AOs that will provide assurance
that Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facilities will be audited with professionalism,
consistency, and integrity in accordance with SAC and relevant regulatory
criteria, in addition with the relevant technical aspects such as biorisk
administration, management and biocontainment engineering. The programme
will enhance the rigour and veracity of audit outcomes delivered by recognised
AOs.</p>
<p>Certifiers providing auditing and certification services to BSL-3 facilities
which are regulated by MOH under the Biological Agents and Toxins Act,
will be required to be accredited by SAC within 6 months from the date
of the launch of this scheme. The SS 696:2023 Specification for high containment
(biosafety level 3) facility will set the certification or auditing requirements
of BSL-3 facilities. More information regarding BSL-3 certification or
audit information can be found on the website of the respectively regulatory
authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Interested AOs will be assessed based on CT 17 – SAC Criteria for
Accreditation of Auditing Organisations under Auditing Organisation Accreditation
Scheme. The specific requirements for Bio-risk Management Audits AOs are
detailed in Appendix 4 of SAC CT 17.</p>
<p>Application for accreditation is now open through the SAC accreditation
portal, <a href="https://sacinet2.enterprisesg.gov.sg/landing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SACINET</a>
