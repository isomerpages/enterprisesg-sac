<p><strong><u>Launch of Clean and Green Urban Farms (Layer Farms)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In support of the SG Green Plan, the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC)
is pleased to announce the expansion of our Accreditation Scheme for Product
Certification Scheme to include the area of Clean &amp; Green Urban Farms
(Layer Farms) with effect from 17 December 2024.</p>
<p>Clean &amp; Green Urban Farms certification aims to strengthen Singapore’s
food security towards a resilient future. In addition, the certification
enables local farms to improve productivity, optimise resource utilisation
and minimise waste generation, while at the same time ensuring food safety
and quality through best industry practices. SS 707 – Specification for
clean and green urban farms – Layer farms sets requirements for the operation
of sustainable layer farms and provides guidance on best industry practices
to ensure the quality and safety of products that are sustainably farmed.
This standard caters to chicken and quail layer farms through all phases
of farm production.</p>
<p>The new accreditation area supports the national initiative for Singapore
to be a leading food and agriculture technology hub. With SAC accredited
SS 707 certification, the certification of urban farms are carried out
by competent certification bodies (CBs), to ensure quality assurance at
source and a resilient supply of safe eggs through sustainable production
of quality, safe, clean and green product through use of resource-efficient
technologies and practices by urban farms.</p>
<p>CBs interested to be accredited by SAC for the above scope will be assessed
based on ISO/IEC 17065 and SAC document – CT 26 SAC Criteria for Certification
Bodies (GAP and Clean &amp; Green Urban Farms) under the accreditation
scheme for Product Certification Body.</p>
<p>Application for accreditation is now open through the SAC accreditation
portal, <a href="https://sacinet2.enterprisesg.gov.sg/landing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SACINET</a>
