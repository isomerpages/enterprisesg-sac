<p><strong>Launch of ISO/IEC 42001 Artificial Intelligence Management Systems Accreditation Programme (AIMS)</strong>
</p>
<p>In support of Singapore's vision for responsible AI adoption, the Singapore
Accreditation Council (SAC) is pleased to announce the launch of its new
accreditation programme for ISO/IEC 42001, the international standard for
Artificial Intelligence Management Systems (AIMS), with effect from 17
February 2025.</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 42001 provides a comprehensive framework for organisations to
effectively manage artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It outlines requirements
for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving
an AI management system within an organisation's context. The standard
addresses crucial aspects such as AI governance, risk management, ethical
considerations, and responsible AI practices, ensuring that organisations
can harness the power of AI whilst maintaining trust, transparency, and
accountability.</p>
<p>Implementing ISO/IEC 42001 offers numerous benefits to organisations.
It enhances AI governance structures, leading to improved decision-making
processes and risk mitigation strategies. The standard promotes ethical
AI practices, helping companies build trust with stakeholders and customers.
It also facilitates compliance with evolving AI regulations and standards,
potentially reducing legal and reputational risks. Furthermore, adopting
ISO/IEC 42001 can drive innovation by providing a structured approach to
AI development and deployment, ultimately leading to more robust and reliable
AI systems.</p>
<p>Companies across various sectors stand to benefit from ISO/IEC 42001,
particularly those heavily invested in AI technologies or those looking
to integrate AI into their operations. This includes technology firms,
financial institutions, healthcare providers, manufacturing companies,
and public sector organisations. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
can also leverage this standard to establish credible AI management practices,
potentially opening up new business opportunities.</p>
<p>Certification bodies (CBs) seeking SAC accreditation for ISO/IEC 42001
certification will be assessed against ISO/IEC 17021-1 and ISO/IEC FDIS
42006 - Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of artificial
intelligence management systems. Once ISO/IEC 42006 is officially published,
the accreditation standards will be updated accordingly.&nbsp; SAC accreditation
aims to ensure CBs are competent to certify organisations' AIMS, thereby
promoting quality assurance and responsible AI practices across industries.</p>
<p>Application for accreditation is now open through the SAC accreditation
portal, <a href="https://sacinet2.enterprisesg.gov.sg/landing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SACINET</a>
