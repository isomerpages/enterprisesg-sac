<p><strong>Launch of Accreditation Programme on Lift &amp; Escalator Inspection under Inspection Body Scheme</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>SAC is pleased to expand our accreditation scheme for Inspection Bodies
to include the inspection of Lift &amp; Escalator, effective from 15<sup>th</sup> April
2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The new accreditation programme provides assurance for inspections
carried out by competent firms for lift &amp; escalator. With the increasing
complexity of modern lift systems, sophisticated electronic controls, safety
mechanisms and high-speed operations, accredited inspections become more
crucial to ensure various considerations are well-addressed by both the
organisation and its inspectors. Accreditation provides independent attestation
that inspection bodies possess the technical competence, qualified personnel,
and robust management systems necessary to perform thorough safety assessments.
This programme helps building owners and facility managers provide public
confidence that their lifts and escalators have been examined by organisations
in accordance to internationally recognised standards.</p>
<p>Interested applicants will undergo assessment based on ISO/IEC 17020:2012,
along with the relevant SAC documents and the following Technical Note,
under the accreditation scheme for Inspection Bodies:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>The application for accreditation is now open through SAC’s Accreditation
Management portal, <a href="https://sacinet2.enterprisesg.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SACINET</a>
