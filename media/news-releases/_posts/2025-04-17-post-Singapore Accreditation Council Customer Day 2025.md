<p><strong>Singapore Accreditation Council Customer Day 2025</strong>

<p>The Singapore Accreditation Council Leadership and the Secretariat from
Enterprise Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) Customer Day 2025, held on 6
March at the Suntec Singapore Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre, brought
together 200 representatives from accredited conformity assessment bodies
(CABs) and SAC's partners. This year’s theme "Navigating Global Challenges,
Shaping Our Future", explored how accreditation can help organisations
navigate an increasingly complex global landscape shaped by technological
advancements, geopolitical shifts, supply chain disruptions and climate
change.</p>
<p>In his opening address, SAC Chair, Mr Amos Leong, outlined SAC's strategic
response to global challenges whilst ensuring Singapore and SAC stays relevant
and recognised in the international accreditation ecosystem. He highlighted
three critical focus areas: technology, with emphasis on cybersecurity
and AI governance; sustainability, where Singapore aims to influence global
standards development; and renewable energy, which presents significant
growth opportunities for the accreditation sector. He added that SAC had
already stepped up on our efforts to advance our interest areas and efforts
include engagement with international climate programme owners as well
strengthening engagements with regional and international counterparts.
He also shared SAC’s efforts and support for international activities,
which included the election of SAC Director Tan Yee Teck to the Asia Pacific
Accreditation Cooperation’s (APAC) Executive Committee in June 2024.</p>

<p>Mr Amos Leong, SAC Chair, delivering his opening speech.</p>
<p>The event featured three dynamic breakout sessions, led by SAC Deputy
Chairs Er Peter Leong, Er Yvonne Soh, and Mr Jagadish CV. These sessions
fostered enriching discussions on energy, sustainability and technology
respectively, with industry experts sharing insights on global trends,
emerging opportunities, and the capabilities needed to establish Singapore
as a regional standards and conformance hub. The breakout sessions also
created a space for participants to engage in meaningful dialogues about
their organisations' expansion plans and strategies to capture new market
opportunities.</p>

<p>The breakout sessions revealed significant opportunities for accredited
testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) services across energy, sustainability,
and technology sectors. Participants expressed interest in expanding their
services into emerging areas, particularly in areas of sustainability reporting
verification, artificial intelligence and alternative energy sources. However,
participants highlighted key challenges, including the need to acquire
skilled talent with niche know-how, as well as unfamiliarity to navigate
complex, evolving regulatory requirements across different markets, which
create barriers to entry.</p>
<p>Building on the momentum of our engaging breakout sessions, we moved on
to the highlight of the day by recognising 48 newly accredited CABs for
their commitment to excellence and contribution to enhancing Singapore's
quality infrastructure.</p>

between SAC, the Singapore Standards Council, and the TIC industry, to
maintain an effective national Standards &amp; Conformance ecosystem. She

strengthening, supporting, and advancing emerging growth opportunities.</p>
