<p><strong>Launch of Accreditation Programme on Verification of Carbon Footprint of Product under Validation &amp; Verification Body&nbsp;Scheme</strong>
</p>
<p>In support of the SG Green Plan,&nbsp;the Singapore Accreditation Council
(SAC) is pleased to announce the expansion of our&nbsp;accreditation scheme
for Validation and Verification Bodies to include verification of carbon
footprint of product, with effect from 04 July 2025.&nbsp;
<br>With increasing emphasis and adoption by local and global stakeholders
and regulators, more organisations and businesses are stepping up efforts
to adopt climate and sustainability measures. This includes measuring carbon
footprints of their products to meet growing demands from consumers, regulators,
investors, and supply chain partners. The accreditation programme on verification
of carbon footprint of product, in accordance with ISO 14067, aims to enhance
access to transparent and reliable GHG data, supporting the development
of low carbon products and services, and in turn, advance Singapore’s transition
towards a low-carbon economy.
