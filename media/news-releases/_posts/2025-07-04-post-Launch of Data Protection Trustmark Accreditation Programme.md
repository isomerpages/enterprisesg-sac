<p><strong>Launch of Data Protection Trustmark Accreditation Programme</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC)
is pleased to announce the launch of a new accreditation programme under
the management system certification body scheme for SS 714:2025 Data Protection
Trustmark (DPTM) certification, with effect on 07 July 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The SS DPTM certification was established to advance Singapore's
digital economy strategy and reinforce its position as a trusted global
data hub. Organisations that adopt DPTM will strengthen their accountability
and conformance to generally accepted personal data protection standards
and best practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This accreditation programme ensures certification bodies (CBs)
demonstrate the necessary competence to conduct SS 714 audits. CBs will
undergo assessment based on ISO/IEC 17021-1 and SAC CT 34 (SAC Criteria
for Certification Bodies (DPTM)).</p>
