<p>On 01 January 2026, a new single international accreditation organisation,
the Global Accreditation Cooperation Incorporated has been established
to bring together the work of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF)
and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Global Accreditation Cooperation Incorporated has
commenced full operations as of 1 January 2026, including the launch of
its own Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;W<strong>hat this means for SAC and our stakeholders:</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;SAC has successfully applied for and received full membership status
with the Global Accreditation Cooperation Incorporated. This ensures continuity
of recognition for all existing SAC accreditations previously issued under
the ILAC Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) and IAF Multilateral Recognition
Arrangement (MLA).</p>
<p>All current accreditations remain valid and recognised as the transition
to the new Global Accreditation Cooperation Incorporated MRA takes place.
We want to assure you that there will be no interruption to your accreditation
and our accreditation services during this transition period. The use of
the existing IAF and ILAC marks will remain valid during the transition
and will continue to remain valid until full adoption of the Global Accreditation
Cooperation Incorporated new mark. Additionally, the IAF and ILAC websites
will remain available for archival/reference purposes, to allow stakeholders
to continue accessing documents and other information.</p>
